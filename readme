Electronic gate (Arduino project)
System components:
1-	Push button -------------------------  to turn on / off the system.
2-	Servo motor -------------------------  indicates state of electronic gate
3-	Two LDR sensors -------------------   one for entrees the other for leavers
4-	2 LEDs ---------------------------------  red LED and green LED
5-	Buzzer ---------------------------------  to alarm for maximum number of persons.
6-	Resistors (1k , 330 ohm) , Arduino board, breadboard and wires.
System description (mechanism);
The system simulates an electronic gate for persons.
When they come near to the gate from out side the LDR send a signal to servo motor to open the gate for entrees
and the red LED lights up to indicate that one person has entered and the count increase by 1.
When one person inside the room decided to go out, when he/she comes near to the gate
another LDR responsible for leavers send a signal to servo motor to open the gate
and green LED lights up to indicate that one person has left the room and the count decrease by 1
If the count exceed 5 then the buzzer is shouted an alarm and the gate only opened for leavers and not open for entrees any more
